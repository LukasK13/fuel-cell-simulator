# Fuel Cell Simulator
The fuel cell simulator provides a graphical user interface to predict the cell voltage of a fuel cell based on its operating conditions.
The simulator uses a neural network based digital twin that was developed for fuel cell performance prediction.
More details about the digital twin can be found in the [Fuel Cell Digital Twin]() article.
